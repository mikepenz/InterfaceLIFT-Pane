My work
==================
I just edited the PrefPANE to download all images to {USER}/pictures/InterfaceLIFT, so you can reuse downloaded images in the future.

Another small change is that there are now more threads to download thumbnails, pictures, ... (It seems faster for me, if you have a slow internet it will be slower but yeah xD)

The last change is that the image resolution is hardcoded and only the PrefPANE will only download the specific resolution (see the name of the PrefPANE). You ask why i've done this?
I use a RETINA Mac and it always downloaded lower res images (i think 1920x1080 or something similiar). Not sure if the autodetect is correct for normal MacBooks and Macs, but i've done a few versions so it should work for everyone else too.

If a specific resolution is missing let me know: [TWITTER](http://twitter.com/mike_penz) or via Google Plus [GPLUS](https://plus.google.com/102816248419100947174/posts)

Last but not least. Head over to github's download section and download the zip. You will find all PrefPANEs in there...
